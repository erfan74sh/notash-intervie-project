# Notash Co. Interview Project

This is a simple app that use M3O user API for register and login services.
These are the tasks I was asked to do.:

- initial project in git
- authentication service (Login, Logout)
- after login show the current time
- prevent showing the current time page without login
- create Unit test for the login page
- after build project, in the chunk file, all routes can view: You try to come up with a solution to hide routs

## Credits

This Project was built as an interview project for Notash co. and I designed a simple UI for it.
